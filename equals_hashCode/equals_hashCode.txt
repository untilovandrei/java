equals(Object obj): a method provided by java.lang.Object that indicates whether some other object passed as an argument is "equal to" the current instance. The default implementation provided by the JDK is based on memory location â€” two objects are equal if and only if they are stored in the same memory address.

hashcode(): a method provided by java.lang.Object that returns an integer representation of the object memory address. By default, this method returns a random integer that is unique for each instance. This integer might change between several executions of the application and won't stay the same.


hashcode(obj1) = hashcode(obj2) 	 =>		obj1.equals(obj2) = true
