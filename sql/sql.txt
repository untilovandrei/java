DBMS - Database Management System (DBMS) is a program that controls creation, maintenance and use of a database. 

RDBMS - Relational Database Management System stores the data into the collection of tables, which is related by common fields between the
		columns of the table. It also provides relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the tables.
		Ex : Oracle Database, SQL Server.

SQL -	stands for Structured Query Language , and it is used used to perform tasks such as retrieval, updation, insertion and deletion of data 		from a database.
		Ex : MySQL, SQLite.

Database - is an organized form of data for easy access, storing, retrieval and managing of data.

Primary key - combination of fields which uniquely specify a row. This is a special kind of unique key, and it has implicit NOT NULL 
		constraint. It means, Primary key values cannot be NULL.

Unique key -uniquely identified each record in the database. This provides uniqueness for the column or set of columns.

Foreign key - column(s) which can be related to the primary key of another table. Relationship needs to be created between two tables by 
		referencing foreign key with the primary key of another table.

Join - keyword used to query data from more tables based on the relationship between the fields of the tables

-------------------------------
Normalization - the process of minimizing redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table of a database. The main aim of Normalization
		is to add, delete or modify field that can be made in a single table.

	>>>>>	First Normal Form (1NF):
This should remove all the duplicate columns from the table. Creation of tables for the related data and identification of unique columns.


	>>>>>	Second Normal Form (2NF):
Meeting all requirements of 1NF. Creation of relationships between the tables using primary keys.


	>>>>>	Third Normal Form (3NF):
Meeting all requirements of 2NF. Removing the columns which are not dependent on primary key constraints.


	>>>>>	Fourth Normal Form (4NF):
Meeting all requirements of 3NF. It should not have multi-valued dependencies.

A view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. Views are not virtually present, and it takes less space to store. View can have data of one or more tables combined, and it is depending on the relationship.


Index - performance tuning method of allowing faster retrieval of records from the table. An index creates an entry for each value and it will 
		be faster to retrieve data.
		* Unique Index - indexing does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. 
						Unique index can be applied automatically when primary key is defined.
		* Clustered Index - reorders the physical order of the table and search based on the key values. 
						Each table can have only one clustered index.
		* NonClustered Index - NonClustered Index does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains logical order of data. 
						Each table can have 999 nonclustered indexes.

Trigger - code or programs that automatically execute with response to some event on a table or view in a database. 
		Mainly, trigger helps to maintain the integrity of the database.
