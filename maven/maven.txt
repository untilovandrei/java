"Maven Phase" - a stage in the Maven build lifecycle (responsible for a specific task).
	ex: mvn <PHASE>

	<<< This won't only execute the specified phase but all the preceding phases as well >>>
 run the "deploy" phase – which is the last phase in the default build lifecycle 
 						– that will execute all phases before the deploy phase as well, which is the entire default lifecycle:


There are three built-in build lifecycles: 
	- default 
	- clean 
	- site

-	"test-compile": compile the test source code
-	"test": run unit tests
-	"package": package compiled source code into the distributable format (jar, war, …)
-	"integration-test": process and deploy the package if needed to run integration tests
-	"install": install the package to a local repository
-	"deploy": copy the package to the remote repository
